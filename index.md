# Piraterna

Welcome to **Piraterna**, a group dedicated to creating **100% open-source** and **free software**.

## About Piraterna

*Piraterna* means *The Pirates* in Swedish. The project began on **November 26, 2024**, with the idea of forming a group focused entirely on freedom-oriented software development.  

Our mission is simple: to create tools and libraries that anyone can use, modify, and share without restrictions. We prioritize openness, collaboration, and respect for user freedom.  

If you believe in building a freer, more open software ecosystem, youâ€™re in the right place. Join us in creating software that belongs to everyone.
