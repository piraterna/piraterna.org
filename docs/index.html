        <p>Welcome to <strong>Piraterna</strong>, a group dedicated to creating <strong>100% open-source</strong> and <strong>free software</strong>.</p>

        <section>
            <h2>About Piraterna</h2>
            <p><strong>Piraterna</strong> is a group based in Sweden that focuses on freedom. The name <em>Piraterna</em> means <em>The Pirates</em> in Swedish. The project began on <strong>November 26, 2024</strong>, with the idea of forming a group dedicated to freedom-oriented software development.</p>
            <p>Our mission is simple: to create tools and libraries that anyone can use, modify, and share without restrictions. We prioritize openness, collaboration, and respect for user freedom.</p>
            <p>If you believe in building a freer, more open software ecosystem, you’re in the right place. Join us in creating software that belongs to everyone.</p>

            <h2>What We Believe</h2>
            <p><strong>Piraterna</strong> is a non-political, non-profit organization focused entirely on promoting freedom through open-source software. We believe that technology should empower users, not restrict them. Our core values include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Freedom to use, modify, and share software without restrictions.</li>
                <li>Transparency and openness in all aspects of development.</li>
                <li>Respect for user privacy and autonomy.</li>
                <li>Building a collaborative and inclusive community.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>We remain committed to these principles to ensure that software serves the public good rather than private interests.</p>
