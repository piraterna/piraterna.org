            <h2>About Piraterna</h2>
            <p><strong>Piraterna</strong> is a group based in Sweden that focuses on freedom. The name <em>Piraterna</em> means <em>The Pirates</em> in Swedish. The project began on <strong>November 26, 2024</strong>, with the idea of forming a group dedicated to freedom-oriented software development.</p>
            <p>Our mission is simple: to create tools and libraries that anyone can use, modify, and share without restrictions. We prioritize openness, collaboration, and respect for user freedom.</p>
            <p>If you believe in building a freer, more open software ecosystem, you’re in the right place. Join us in creating software that belongs to everyone.</p>
